## How to run the content?

There are nine \*.Rmd files with the corresponding content. One file corresponds to one lecture. 

After rendering \*.Rmd file, the lecture's content is available in the slidy_presentation format, which one can run in a web browser. 

If needed, there is an \*.R script that reproduced the figures and/or numeric results presented in the lecture. \*.R scripts available in the folder code.
